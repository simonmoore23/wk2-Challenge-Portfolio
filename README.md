# wk2-Challenge-Portfolio

## description

The motivation for this proejct was to build a site that I could use to promote myself and showcase my work
I built this site to host my portfolio so it can be easily accessed from anywhere
This site means I don't need to solely rely on my LinkedIn or CV
I further developed my CSS skillset on this project
This project stands out as it is the first site fully designed by me and is unique in that it is about me
